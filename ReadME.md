To utilise Icon Evaluate, create a folder called "icons" in the source directory or alongside the executable jar, and place icons within it as .png, .jpg, or .jpeg files.

Once the program has finished execution, a file called "Similarity Report.txt" will be output in the source directory or alongside the executable jar.
If the program is run again, the new results will be appended to this file.
